	<p style="text-align:left">My university thesis was a research on an engine providing game genre adaptability. During the gameplay, statistics from the player's behavior are collected to determine the player's preference according to his gameplay.<br />Once the player's preference is determined, the next zone of the map is seamlessly adapted at runtime to match the genre that the player preference, while also adjusting in a more dynamic way various elements and interactions around the map according to specific statistical values.<br />This resulted in a unique experience on every run of the game.</p>
	<p style="text-align:left">In more detail, I designed, programmed and implemented:</p>
	<ul style="text-align:left">
	<li>the adaptability engine</li>
	<li>the creation of the map</li>
	<li>the dialogue system</li>
	<li>the enemies' AI</li>
	<li>the patrol system</li>
	<li>the player's interaction system</li>
	<li>and various other gameplay elements like UI, controller input, etc.</li>
	</ul>
