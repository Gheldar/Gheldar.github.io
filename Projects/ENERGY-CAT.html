	<p style="text-align:left">Energy Cat: the house of tomorrow, is a game that you can learn how to reduce your energy bill by making small changes in your household, while playing a smart, addictive and enjoyable game. It is part of the EnerGAware project, financed by the European Commission as part of the Horizon2020 program. The main objectives are to provide secure, clean and efficient energy to Europe. </p>
	<p style="text-align:left">I contributed to the development by developing features, debugging and optimization. I also worked on the localization and the creation and implementation of unit tests on Unity's test runner, both editor and runtime.</p>
